# Make Your Own Neural Network in the Browser with p5

Very much in progress, stay tuned!

https://shiffman.github.io/Neural-Network-p5/

This example is for [Nature of Code Intelligence and Learning](https://github.com/shiffman/NOC-S17-2-Intelligence-Learning). It's based on the book [Make Your Own Neural Network](http://amzn.to/2oRW1ax) by Tariq Rashid ([book source code](https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork)).

### Next Steps
* user drawn numbers
* run the network backwards
